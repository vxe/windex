* windex

FIXME: my new application.

** Installation

Download from https://github.com/vxe/windex

** Usage

FIXME: explanation

Run the project directly:

    $ clojure -M -m vxe.windex

Run the project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

    $ clojure -M:test:runner

Build an uberjar:

    $ clojure -M:uberjar

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar windex.jar


** Examples
   #+begin_src clojure
     ;; run powershell commands
     user> (psh "scoop install wget")
     WARN  'wget' (1.20.3) is already installed.
     Use 'scoop update wget' to install a new version.
   #+end_src
